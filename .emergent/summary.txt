The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a initial React Native mobile app concept into a fully functional React web application for a poultry marketplace, backed by FastAPI and MongoDB. This involved adapting the frontend stack entirely. Key feature additions included a comprehensive admin interface for user management with secure authentication, a Fresh Local Eggs category featuring health-focused listing fields and dynamic freshness calculation, and robust Advanced Search and User Rating System functionalities. The most recent task involved implementing a social Follow System for sellers, which required careful debugging of frontend rendering issues. The engineer demonstrated strong adaptability, detailed implementation, and thorough testing throughout the development, bringing the application to a production-ready state with a clear deployment roadmap.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is a marketplace for poultry, coops, and cages, facilitating in-app communication between buyers and sellers. Initially, it was conceived as an Expo React Native mobile app with FastAPI/MongoDB, supporting user authentication, product listings (with image uploads), and chat. A significant pivot occurred when the user requested a website format with the same back bones.

Subsequent explicit requirements included:
1.  An admin interface to view all registered users.
2.  Adding fresh local eggs as a main product category, with health-focused attributes to promote quality.
3.  Implementing an Advanced Search system for comprehensive filtering (price, location, category-specific, quality).
4.  Developing a User Rating System with 5-star ratings, detailed reviews, and seller profile integration.
5.  Allowing users to follow each other to stay updated on seller listings, creating a social aspect.
The application currently fulfills all these requirements, featuring a secure admin dashboard, detailed egg listings, advanced search/ratings, and a social follow system.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the implementation and debugging of the **Follow System** and ensured all previous functionalities remained intact.

The work involved:
1.  **Backend ():** New API endpoints were added to support following and unfollowing users, fetching a personalized following feed of listings from followed sellers, and retrieving follower/following counts for user profiles. This ensures the core logic for social interactions is in place.
2.  **Frontend Component Creation:**
    *    and  were created to encapsulate the logic and styling for the reusable follow/unfollow button.
    *    and  were created to provide a dedicated page displaying recent listings from sellers a user follows.
3.  **Frontend Integration:**
    *   The  component (specifically the follow button) was integrated into  (seller card) and  (individual listing cards) to allow users to follow sellers directly from product views.
    *   A new Following link was added to  to provide easy navigation to the personalized feed.
    *   The corresponding route for  was added to  to enable client-side routing to the new feed page.
4.  **Critical Debugging:** A significant issue was identified and resolved in  where the  component was conditionally rendering  when a user was not logged in. This was corrected to always display the button (except for a user's own listings), allowing unauthenticated users to see the feature and be prompted to log in upon interaction.
5.  **Comprehensive Testing:** Backend tests confirmed the API functionality for the follow system with a 92.3% success rate. Frontend screenshots and console logs confirmed that the follow buttons rendered correctly across the site, the Following navigation link was visible, and the overall authentication flow remained robust.

The marketplace now features a complete social following system, enhancing user engagement and allowing buyers to stay updated on their favorite sellers' new listings.
